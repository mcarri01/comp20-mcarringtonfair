Captain's Log - Lab 7

Estimated time on lab - 3-4 hours

The biggest difficulty was finding an easy way to store the messages in local storage - the posting of the messages in order
appropriate time stamps wasn't that difficult especially with jQuery's syntax. There weren't too many examples to look at online 
that helped, so a lot of the code I had to figure out as I went. 

However, I did end up using 
http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsehtml/ 
in order to easily parse through the local storage into readable text.
