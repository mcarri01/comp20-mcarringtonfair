The purpose of this lab is to practice parsing JSON data using the XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript, along with 
understanding the capabilites of client-side JavaScript.

In this lab I was successfully able to open the JSON file, parse through the data and print out the messages into the
Messages ID in my html file. After having success with that, I tried to access JSON data from the given remote location. 
This also worked, however it brings into the question of the same-origin policy and the limitations of JavaScript in working 
across different origins. In order to work the remote location would need to have the same origin.
