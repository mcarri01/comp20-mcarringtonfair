COMP 20 Fall 2015 Private Repo for Matthew CarringtonFair

Used to store coursework and labs for COMP 20 Web Programming. It contains various labs and assignments ranging from practicing elements of basic HTML/CSS to handling client-side development with JavaScript and jQuery and finally server-side management using Node/Express JS and MongoDB. My favorite aspect, personally, was the server-side assignment to construct the server for MapChat. However, I definitely enjoyed the Security assignment because I found the topic fascinating. 

It is definitely clear how I am developed as a web developer from this course. Starting this course, I knew very basic HTML/CSS and even then didn't quite have enough familiarity to be comfortable with them. Now, I am not only comfortable with them, but I have been able to take those basic elements of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and create web applications for other classes or projects. My understanding of how client-side sites and server-side applications communicate and interact with one another also has increased vastly, and I feel much more capable as a programmer now. 

Things to take away from this course - 
I think learning to pick up from previous examples and not "re-invent the wheel" while still maintaing the understanding of how sections of code works has helped me accelerate the pace of my work and has helped me practice being "flexible" with learning new materials. One example would be in our second assignment, the use of the googlemaps API opened my eyes to how tools like that are so readily available to me as a programmer. Also the use of frameworks such as Express to simplify communicating with clients in server-side development and the use of several APIs in my semester group project has helped build my curiousity for what types of tools are out there to use.

Finally, I think I would like to find projects that I can apply this new-found knowledge. Just recently I created a simple website for a project in my Japanese class, and while it is basic and doesn't have any user or server-side sort of interactions, the fact that I could apply what little portion of my skills to creating something makes me wonder what is possible now.
