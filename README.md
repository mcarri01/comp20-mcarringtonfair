Readme for Lab4 - Responsive Design

Repository includes index.html file, a jpg image file, and a css stylesheet.
Time spent on lab: Approximately 3 hours.
The goal of this lab is to practice coding with responsive design and using sprite images by changing which
area of the image is shown based off the size of the browser window. This same practice can be applied to designing 
websites on various platforms (mobile, tablet, laptop, etc.) and even simply reformatting websites on desktops 
based off the browser window.

I was able to correctly create breakpoints within the page whereas the image (originally a 333x500px image) would only have a 
166.5x125 portion shown at a given time. Which portion of the original image shown was determined by set breakpoints.

Reading by Patrick Sexton on "How to use CSS sprites" (https://varvy.com/pagespeed/combine-images-css-sprites.html) helped
guide my work and gave me an understanding on the format in which you can choose areas of an overall image to display.
