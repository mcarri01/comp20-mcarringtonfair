README for Lab 5 - Duckhunt

Total time spent - Approximately 2 hours

Contains index.html and style.css for basic outline and structure of the page, along with two images -
duckhunt-background.gif which is used as the background image, and duckhunt_various_sheet.png which contains various images that
can be sliced and placed upon the background. Finally, it includes game.js which includes the scripts used to render the images
onto the webpage. The one function within game.js initializes the page by loading the background image and then two seperate
birds from duckhunt_various_sheet.png.
